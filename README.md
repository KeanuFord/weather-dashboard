# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description
A weather board web application that allows the user to search for weather conditions of any city for the current day, and the next 5 days to follow.
Submitting a city name in the search bar on the left will show the current weather in the banner next to it, and below that is a 5 day forecast with each card showing a corresponding day.
Up to the last 10 search querries will be save in local storage and listed in the search history under the search bar. Each query listed is also interactable. Clicking on any of the previous queries will bring the results for that city back on display.
